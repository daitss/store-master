CollectFixities logging is as follows, with potentially long lines:

[1]  ERROR  Fixity Errors: <storemaster url> checksum errors:  DAITSS DB has MD5 of <...>, but silo at <silo url> reports <...>  DAITSS DB has SHA1 of <...>, but silo at <silo url> reports <...>
[2]  ERROR  Integrity Errors: <storemaster url> has too few copies, only: <silo url>
     ERROR  Integrity Errors: <storemaster url> no copies where listed by any of the pools.
     ERROR  Integrity Errors: <storemaster url> missing <1> copy: <silo url> ..
[3]  ERROR  Integrity Errors: <storemaster url> has too many copies: <silo url> <silo url> ...
[4]  WARN   Unexpected Packages: <silo url>
[5]  WARN   Fixity Expirations: <silo url> last checked at <time>


A full log entry for the above includes a prefix, as in:

    Oct  5 12:43:24 fclnx30 CollectFixities[18915]: <phrase from above>

The emailed Collect Fixity Report has same data as above, lightly
formatted to be more readable. I've cross referenced the sections to
their respective log entries as above. Note that sections are only
mailed when there is a problem present.

<storemaster url> is the URL that the DAITSS DB records, <silo url> is
that reported by the silo.

The overall summary for the CollectFixities reports precedes
the following, and is not shown.
