Installing on our target hosts at fcla.edu.


Create a database on the target host.   Here are the steps for mysql

1) create a database for the service, let's call it store_master.

   mysqladmin create store_master

2) initialize the database,  see tools/ddl.mysql 

   mysql -uroot -p store_master < tools/ddl.mysql

3) create a user that has read/write access to the database. Let's
   say for argument that's  user 'silo', password 'top secret' on the database
   'store_master' accessible from 'localhost'. 

4) Create a DNS servername for the service, and assign it the IP number from
   the target host.  Let's call it store-master.fcla.edu for the moment.

5) Configure a web service on the target host
