# Configuration settings for the Store Master Service. On start up,
# the service will first look for a filename using the environment
# variable STOREMASTER_CONFIG_FILE, then will look in the install
# directory (where app.rb is) for a file named 'config.yml'.

# Please avoid the use of TABs for this file.

# Should we log database queries? defaults to false.  These generate
# very large logs, so it's only recommended for troubleshooting.

log_database_queries:        false

# If set, direct log information to this syslog facility (see
# /etc/syslog.conf), otherwise log to STDERR.

log_syslog_facility:       LOG_LOCAL0

# Database connection string, formatted as  
#
#   vendor://username:password@hostname/database" 
#
# Supported vendors: postgres. Some fields are optional - for
# instance, if there is no password,
# "vendor://username@hostname/database"

database_connection_string:  postgres://daitss:topsecret@example.org/store_master

# What hostname are we running the service under?  It is entered in the logs. Defaults
# to the hostname of the server

virutal_hostname:            store-master.example.org

# How many pool servers are we required to connect to?  Defaults to 2. Use zero for
# a 'stub server' for testing - in that case, nothing will actually be stored.

required_pools:              2

# Where should temporary files be created? This should be at least twice the size of the
# largest package you plan to ingest, plus headroom. 

# temp_directory:           /var/tmp/
