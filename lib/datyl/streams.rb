  # A stream, for us, is a sequence of key/value pairs where the keys
  # are sorted in ascending order.  The key will typically be a string
  # (it must support <, >, ==); the values can be anything, but will
  # often be a string or an array of strings.  All streams must support
  # the following methods:

  #    new      - specialized processing for your constructor
  #    read     - return key, value pair, or nil if at end of stream
  #    eos?     - true if at end of stream
  #    rewind   - resets the stream to the beginning and returns the stream
  #
  # Then include CommonStreamMethods, which give you:
  #
  #    each do |key, value| - successively yields key/value pairs off the stream.
  #    filters              - a list of procs (takes k, v; returns true/false) that will filter the stream
  #    key, value = get     - reads a single key/value pair off the stream. Returns nil when eos? is true.
  #    unget                - forget that we've read the last key/value pair - we'll get it on next pass - only one level
  #    <=> stream           - returns a specialized comparison stream between self and second stream
  #
  # Additionally, there should be a good diagnostic #to_s method on
  # all stream classes; that string will often appear in log messages.
